Hello Technophile!! Welcome to my GitHub profile..If you visit my profile on GitHub, youâ€™ll notice that it contains images that is image recognition using machine learning.I have done a currency recognition of 3 different nations.In our world there are many currency notes it is difficult to identify where it belongs.I have done a project on it.It's a team work project.To beign with the project I have imported the libraries such as skimage which is useful to extract the features and to recognize them.I have imported the currency images of China,Indonesia,Norway.To recognize them I have converted them into  grey scale and then resized and reshaped.I found edges of the images usong SOBEL.Then I have merged the three data frames them into a single dataframe and shuffled them its purpose is to break possible biases during data preparation.Then I have found accuracy  and metices of the images. Metrics are used to monitor and measure the performance of a model.This is my project Hope u like it.Thank you
