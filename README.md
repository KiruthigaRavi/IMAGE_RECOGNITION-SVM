# CURRENCY RECOGNITION USING SVM

<P>
This project falls within the domain of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on completing tasks through predictions. Specifically, it involves creating an image recognition system using supervised learning techniques.The objective is to identify currencies from three countries: China, Indonesia, and Norway.The project utilized the Anaconda Navigator platform, specifically Jupyter Notebook, as the primary development environment. Various libraries and tools were employed, including OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-image, Matplotlib, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).The workflow involved importing a dataset containing images of currency notes from the aforementioned countries. These images were then processed and labeled accordingly. Supervised learning techniques, particularly the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, were employed for classification tasks.After training the model on the labeled dataset, its performance was evaluated using performance metrics such as a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix allows for an assessment of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The project aimed to achieve a high accuracy score, indicating the model's ability to accurately classify currency notes from the three target countries.
